# DECLASSIFIED: HOTEL-LAMUH INTERCEPT 

We intercepted an internal Soviet report believed to describe a cryptographic incident at Station HOTEL-LAMUH. 

The author assumed interception was likely. The report was protected using a routine field method consistent with other captured paperwork from the same era, using a key between 8-12 bytes. 

You are given the standard report header exactly as used. 

Your task: 
- Recover the report contents. 
- Follow the report's own evidence to recover the flag. 
- Use the recovered flag to unlock the reward archive.

Files provided: 
- `header.txt` - The standard report header.
- `report.enc.hex` - The encrypted report in hex format.
- `reward.7z` - The reward archive, locked with the recovered flag.

Good luck, comrade.
